# Battle Mechanics
First of all, you should know that the game is designed to be easy, since it is just a technical demo to reach the final boss.  
The final boss is a bit more challenging, because it is the final fight.

About the battle, the game uses a turn-based combat system where the attack speed determines which character acts first. Each battle follows these rules:

1. **Turn Order:**  
   - The character with higher speed attacks first.  
   - After the first attack, turns alternate between the player and the enemy.

2. **Player Actions:**  
   - On your turn, you can choose to **attack**, **use a potion**, **run away**, or **look at your stats** if you donâ€™t remember them.
   - When you choose to **run away** during a battle, you have a **65% chance to escape successfully**, or a **35% chance to fail and lose your turn**.
   - Using a potion consumes your turn, so you cannot attack in the same round.  
   - Looking at your stats doesn't consume a turn.
   - Strategic use of potions is key to surviving tougher enemies and bosses.

3. **Potion Effects:**  
   - **Healing Potion:** Restores 100 HP.  
   - **Damage Potion:** Adds 50 attack points for the current turn.  
   - There is no attack speed potion, keeping turn order fair and predictable.

4. **Enemy Progression:**  
   - Initially, battles are against normal enemies.  
   - After defeating **5 normal enemies**, subsequent enemies become **minibosses**.  
   - After defeating **10 total enemies**, the **final boss** appears.  

5. **Winning and Losing:**  
   - Winning a battle allows you to advance and face the next enemy.  
   - Losing a battle ends the game, so managing your health and potion usage is crucial.  
   - The final boss is significantly stronger, making the use of potions and strategy essential for victory.
